Included linear and multi-linear regressions, logistic regression, basic supervised learning with random forests and decision trees, as well as k-means clustering and a brief introduction into unsupervised learning. Model metrics and comparisons, as well as basic statistical concepts were taught.\n\n## Computer Science\n\n#### Computer Science 227: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\nIntroduction to the basics of both Java and Object Oriented Programming as a whole. Focus on abstraction, encapsulation, and an early introduction to commonly used algorithms.\n\n#### Computer Science 228: Introduction to Data Structures\nCovers all of the usual data structures in programming, lists, arrayLists, doubly linked lists, trees, binary trees, hashmaps, stacks, queues, and many more! Class taught in Java.\n\n#### Computer Science 311: Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms\nIntroduction to graph algorithms, dyanmic programming, runtime analysis, and proof of correctness for written algorithms. Basic introduction to the concept of P and NP problems. Emphasis on divide and conquer, recursive, and memoization.\n\n#### Computer Science 363: Introduction to Database Management Systems\nIntroduction to SQL style database management, primarily using MySQL. Querying using SQL, and query optimization using different joins. Two phase locking, relational algebra, and other database concepts discussed. Brief introduction to graph databases such as Neo4j.\n\n#### Computer Engineering 419: Software Tools for Large Scale Data Analysis\nIntroduction to Hadoop, distributed databases, and Apache Spark. Looking at issues regarding data durability, and consistency, issues in unstructured and bulk data. Variety of languages and programming abilities used including Pig, Java, Linux systems, and writing parralel code to be run on a cluster.\n\n#### Computer Science 511: Design and Analysis of Algorithms\nGraduate level class that looks at advanced algorithms and handling of P and NP problems. A focus on the Bellman-Ford Method of handling flow networks, conversion between NP Problems and proofs concerning NP completeness, and estimation and heuristic approximations to NP problems.\n\n## Statistics\n\n#### Statistics 347: Probability and Theory for Data Science\nTheoretical statistics, introduction to a variety of distributions such as binomial, geometric, poisson, normal, gamma, and beta. A variety proofs concerning those distributions in their moment generating functions, expected values and more. Also featured an introduction to point estimators, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Heavy focus on use of R and statistical simulation.\n\n#### Statistics 477: Introduction to categorical variables\nIntroduction to the handling of categorical variables including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, sampling sizes, tests of independence. Emphasis on visualization as well as numerical summaries. Heavy focus on use of R and statistical simulation.\n\n#### Statistics 588: Statistical Theory for Research Workers\nGraduate level class that gives a more advanced and applied look at distributions with a heavier focus on their applications in research. A variety of new distributions were taught, and an emphasis on learning when and how to model real world data using the distributions in class. R was used for simulations\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nA list of classes I feel were particularly interesting!\n\n## Certifications\n\n![AWS Cloud Practitioner Badge](./aws-certified-cloud-practitioner.png) [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/9b82447e-70f1-4d09-a99c-b44662639056/public_url)\n\n## Data Science\n\n#### Data Science 201: Introduction to Data Science\nBasics and introduction to a variety of methods of modeling in Python.
